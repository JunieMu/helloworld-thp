How to Call the Caption Pipeline API

Use this base URL for all API calls: https://api.almostcrackd.ai


You will make requests in this order:



Generate a presigned upload URL

Upload image bytes to that presigned URL

Register the uploaded image URL with the pipeline

Generate captions from the registered image

Requirements


A valid JWT access token

Include auth header on API routes:

Authorization: Bearer <your-token>



Supported image content types:

image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif, image/heic




Step 1: Generate Presigned URL

Request

POST https://api.almostcrackd.ai/pipeline/generate-presigned-url


Headers:


Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

Body:


{
  "contentType": "image/jpeg"
}

Response

{
  "presignedUrl": "https://....",
  "cdnUrl": "https://presigned-url-uploads.almostcrackd.ai/<userId>/<filename>.jpg"
}


presignedUrl: direct upload target (S3 signed URL)

cdnUrl: public URL of the uploaded image (used in Step 3)

Step 2: Upload Image Bytes to presignedUrl

This is a PUT request directly to the returned presignedUrl (not to api.almostcrackd.ai).


await fetch(presignedUrl, {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": file.type
  },
  body: file
});

Important: Content-Type should match what you sent in Step 1.

Step 3: Register Image URL in the Pipeline

Request

POST https://api.almostcrackd.ai/pipeline/upload-image-from-url


Headers:


Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

Body:


{
  "imageUrl": "<cdnUrl from Step 1>",
  "isCommonUse": false
}

Response

{
  "imageId": "uuid-value",
  "now": 1738690000000
}

Save imageId for the caption step.

Step 4: Generate Captions

Request

POST https://api.almostcrackd.ai/pipeline/generate-captions


Headers:


Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

Body:


{
  "imageId": "uuid-value-from-step-3"
}

Response

Returns an array of caption records generated and saved by the system.
